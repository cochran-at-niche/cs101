# Searching and Sorting

[Class 4 Lecture Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1INd__JkD1sxe2vVvAiAZw068FkK4p2O7HPjcgFd_NHQ/edit?usp=sharing)

In all of the data structures we've built so far, the `Contains` method was a
sequential search with a big O time complexity of O(n). It is possible to do
better by utilizing binary search (which has a time complexity of O(log n), but
only if the array is sorted. How can we efficiently sort an array, and what is
the big O time complexity of doing so?

## Assignment

Your task is to implement an efficient sorting algorithm. By efficient, I mean
that it has a best-case/average-case time complexity of O(n log n). I recommend
one of the following:

* [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
* [Quick sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
* [Heap sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort)
